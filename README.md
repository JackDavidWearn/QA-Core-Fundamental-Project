# QA-Core-Fundamental-Project
Repository for the DevOps Core Fundamental Project

## Getting Started
The first step in starting this project was to decide on an idea for the project. 
The idea that I have decided to pursue is: 

## Risk Assessment
The next step after deciding on the projects idea was to create a risk assessment. 
This is a table which outlines the possible risks to the project, the likelihood of the risk occuring, the impact the risk would have to the project, the control that will take place to minimise/reduce the risk and how frequent that control needs to be carried out. The table can be seen below:

## ERD
After creating the Risk Assessment table, I have created the below ERD. 
This outlines the relationship between the different tables in the database which the application will use, and how these tables will be setup.
